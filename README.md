File handling in C is crucial for many applications. It allows the storage and retrieval of data for persistent storage, making programs more versatile. The main functions for file handling are fopen(), fclose(), fprintf(), fscanf(), and fgets().

1.File Creation and Writing:

exists, its contents are erased. fprintf() is used to write formatted data into the file.

2.Reading Data:

To read the content of a file, the "r" mode is used with fopen(). Functions like fscanf() and fgets() help read data from the file.

3.Appending Data:

The "a" mode is used with fopen() to append data to an existing file. This mode ensures that the existing content remains intact while new data is added to the end.

4.ERROR Handling:

Before performing operations, the program checks if the file is opened successfully. If not, it prints an error message.
